Hiring Contract Teachers


In these programs, local instructors are recruited on a temporary contract, usually for one academic year. Their role is to support basic instruction in early grades (typically Grade 1–4) and to help reduce class sizes in overcrowded schools. These instructors may or may not have formal teacher training.



Providing Financial Incentives


In these programs, regular teachers are provided with financial incentives based on their students' test scores to encourage them to put more effort into supporting student learning. This means they receive a bonus if their students achieve better results in national tests.

        The Impact of Financial Incentives on Learning:
        
          A scientific study evaluated a program that offered financial incentives to teachers based on their students’
          test score improvements.
        
        
          On average, students in schools where teachers received incentives scored about
          5 points higher (on a 100-point test) than students in schools without incentives.
        
        
          However, there is statistical uncertainty. Based on the data, the real difference could be anywhere between

That level of variability introduces meaningful uncertainty when making a real donation on someone’s behalf. In contrast, financial incentives for teachers produce more modest gains, but those gains are consistently observed across settings, with a much narrower uncertainty range. This makes the intervention more predictable and easier to defend from an evidence-based standpoint. By weighting my donation toward the more reliable program while still supporting the higher-upside but riskier option, I aimed to balance impact with accountability, ensuring that the majority of funds are likely to generate measurable benefits while still allowing room for potentially larger gains.

Contract Teachers (Option A):

Average effect: +5 points on a 100-point test

Possible range: 1–9 points

This program has the highest potential impact and could significantly improve learning outcomes, especially in underserved schools.

Because of this higher expected gain, it receives the largest portion of the donation ($350).

Splitting the donation $250/$250 reflects a balanced, neutral approach that values both potential impact and reliability. This allocation also manages risk by not overcommitting to one program, ensuring that the donation supports meaningful improvements regardless of which intervention proves more effective.

It stated that students scores on average 3 points higher and that the margin for error could be as low as 2 points and as high as 4 points. That's not very far off the mark of the 3 points the study suggests. I would rather allocate more money to a method of teaching that shows better, more clear results.

I really believe that the only people that can actually ""change"" student learning is the students themselves, and the parents of the students. The big problem is that students don't want to learn, for any number of reasons, but one that's for sure is the fact that some of these classroom sizes are too large, and kids that need help don't get help, and then it's just a snowball effect where they stay behind. I think that hiring more teachers could potentially help this situation, which should at least help some kids get what they need, and grades/learning should just organically improve. I do NOT believe that giving teachers more money is going to fix anything. They can't MAKE the students learn anything. Full disclosure, my brother is an English teacher, so I see/hear about these things all the time. You could give these teachers a million dollars and that's not guaranteeing that the students are going to learn better. HOWEVER, I do believe that there are some teachers out there who are not living up to their own potential. So I do think that maybe SOME teachers might actually get motivation/encouragement to TRY HARDER at teaching, and maybe there are some things they would do that could help the kids learn more effectively. So I wanted to give the most money to the place I think would be the most effective, but also didn't want to rule out other options.",1,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,4,1,3,1,,1,1,5e836a3c2598d409928dae31,6978c12ff9021b5b8bd37de6,6972293d33b31d60529f1ef3,3b

What we discovered was that when you tell teachers that scores on a particular test are extremely important, the teachers will ""teach to the test"".  This definitely improves test scores but has been shown to have little bearing on improvements in actual student life (and career) skills.  All it shows is that teaching to the test will improve test scores.  Interestingly, that was an important piece of information, because the purveyors of the SAT and ACT have all along been insisting that this is impossible, despite a growing industry of for profit corporations providing SAT or ACT coaching for the purposes of helping get into ""better"" colleges.

I think that just throwing money at contract teachers no doubt has its own problems, but I personally have a little bit of experience there as well.  I have been a software developer for most of my career, but I took 2 years off and worked as a paraprofessional, split between 2 middle school band programs.

Balancing Scientific Results: Even though the study for financial incentives showed a slightly higher gain (5 points) compared to contract teachers (3 points), you may feel that both results are positive enough to deserve funding.

Managing Uncertainty: Since learning environments are complex, you might feel it is safer to invest in two different strategies rather than putting all your money into just one, just in case one method works better in some schools than others.

Addressing Multiple Needs: You are helping to solve two separate issues: the need for better teaching effort (incentives) and the need for smaller class sizes (contract teachers).",1,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,ASSOCIATES,4,2,2,7,,1,1,694cbd12586b3cac3dc05175,6979b2f07002c6be8dda928a,6972293d33b31d60529f1ef3,3a

These are facts.  I know how these dot orgs operate.  I know how the educational system in (and without) the United States has been absolutely decimated by these hive-mind ideas which can be accurately described as communistic, spirit-destroying, redistribution campaigns marching under the banner of education.  I've had it with all these leftist wastes of money.  The very premise of this study is based on redistribution - redistributing my money (or someone's, probably tax-funded).  It's the same people who created ""leave no child behind"".  All that program did was take from the brightest and most interested kids and give it to kids who - in nearly all cases - had little to zero interest in being in the classroom.  There will always be gradients in life.  Some people will be more affluent.  Some will be more intellectually imbued.  Some less.
